Call Blocker Professional v5.25 For BlackBerry

Call Blocker Professional (CBP) offers nearly every feature you could imagine for a call blocking app. When a blocked call comes in, you can choose to send the caller to your voicemail, or pick up and hang up on them so they do not even know they were blocked and can't bother you with voicemails.
You can have CBP automatically enable and disable itself at certain times, for example to block calls at night, but allow them during the day. You can even set up custom exclusions to allow certain numbers, such as family members, to get through regardless of your other settings.
An icon is placed on your home screen which shows the current mode (Enabled or Disabled), and allows you to toggle it with a single click. With the icon updating according to its mode, it is always simple to tell what is going on. To make it even easier, a small icon can optionally be placed in your notification bar when CBP is enabled (OS 4.7+ only).
You can view a comprehensive list of blocked calls, with the ability to call back with a single click.
